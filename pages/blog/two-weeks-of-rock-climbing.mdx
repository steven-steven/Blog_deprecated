# Two Weeks of Climbing

<Time>{meta.date}</Time>

**Disclaimer: This is a reflection from a newb climber. May contain misleading and incorrect information. Seek a rock climbing real expert with experience for better suggestions.**

Tomorrow marks the end of my two week membership at Boulderz Climbing Centre at Junction Triangle in Toronto. I've been going to that gym once every 2 days. 1 day to recover was incredibly challanging for me especially when I injured myself. I learned to take better care of my hands now.

How it all Begin:
Two weeks ago Steven Xiong, a friend in my class, asked me if I wanted to rock climb with him. I had _the thought_ of doing it a few times in the past but never have actually gone to try it. So I replied with a BIG YES!

I mean, I am strong enough to hold a handstand and I can do at least 5 pullups so surely moving my weight between rocks wouldn't be too difficult right?

## I was wrong

![Flap Injury](/static/blogAssets/two-weeks-of-rock-climbing/flap.png)

Sorry about the gory image above. I got a flap; apparanly its common injury in climbing. I was lucky it wasn't deep. I should've moistured my hands more to prevent it.

Some pros I see in that gym didn't seem particulary well-built. All you need is to be **Technique**-ally capable (excuse my English), and that takes LOTS of experience and training.

Here are points I learned over the past 2 weeks:

### Focus on legs and ass

I shouldn't focus on climbing with arms. Focus on legs instead since they are so much stronger. If the arm is the main actor, then the leg is its stunt double (they do all the work).

Instead of looking for which rock to hold next, I should decide at which foothold to step on beforehand.

I pay a lot of attention on my ass while climbing. Not because of the people watching, but I think it was a good indication of my centre of mass. It's bad if I have to carry my weight around; instead of shifting my weight to my strong foot. For example, I would try to get my lower half to be close to my foot so that it carries all the weight.

### Hands straight

I heard this advise a lot. Like how its easier to hold a shopping bag with straight arms, or how monkeys hang on a tree, a straight arm put less strain and energy on your arms.
Of course, you will need to bend it to move around, but when you're holding a position, don't do it with bent arms.

### My fingers hurt

I am still having trouble with it, but I feel more conforable climbing with my fingers now. I feel like I should use more _distant phalange_ (the upper section of your finger) more than the _middle/proximal phalanges_ (lower sectionof the fingers).
For one thing, it hurts less. When I grab the rocks using the middle phalanges I feel tortured. It felt like that part of the fingers are pinched so hard.

I still can't use the hangboard with my fingers. You are supposd to hang yourself with only your fingers on the board. It is torture but i hope my fingers can get stronger.

### Balance

When I see pros climb, they seem to make moves that is not apparant to me. For example, stretching out the leg to one direction while reaching the arms out to a hold in the opposite direction. It was all for balance, and they are aware of which positions would make the most efficiency (minimal strength).
I'm guessing this is something I'd only get by more practice. Being self-aware about my balance positions.

### Shoes

Halfway through I just realized that everyone wasn't wearing socks. Which was a big revelation because exposing your toes on the shoes definitely give more control.
Another thing I noticed is it gets so smelly after climbing! I'm rethinking if I should buy my own climbing shoes and whether I have the time to clean it.

### Strategy

Its all about the Beta. You're given a bnch of rocks on the wall and you should plan out how to reach the top, in the most effective way of course.

## How I can improve

1. practice
2. watch people do it and imitate

It's unfortunate that I don't have climbing friends to go with me. I feel it would help lots if someone spectates you as they can give you a better feedback than yourself.

## Would I do it again?

Hell yeah! Definitely going to extend my membership. It was fun.

-   What I love about this sport is that it doesn't feel like working out, but problem solving.
-   The only thing I hate is my weak fingers and arms. They're not letting me get to where I want, and they get worn out quickly after a few climbs.

So I'm trying to do it as efficiently as I could so I can conserve my energy for longer climbs. But as for now, I'll trust that my fingers will get stronger over time.

Please leave a suggestion for me and correct me if anything I said is wrong.

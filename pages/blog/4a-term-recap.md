# Five courses in Four months (a 4B term Recap

<Time>{meta.date}</Time>

Wow, can't believe it's 4 months after I wrote my [3B term recap](https://stevenwhat.me/blog/when-the-storm-ends). This term was another fast and furious ride with deeadlines after deadlines. I took 5 courses (4 TE 1 CSE) after overloading a course. One reason to overload is that it's free (and given I pay 20k+ for my term tuition, an extra course is like 5k value normally). Second reason is that its fully online, meaning I have a lot of time given I'm on my desk all day. Third reason, I was curious what I could take out of these courses.

So here you go. My term recap:

# Layoffs

<Time>{meta.date}</Time>

I haven't written in a while. So much to write, so much to commit, so much postponing. Layoffs were one huge thing that happened this year that I wished not to postpone before end of year. Rooted in the event was common themes like being lost, friendship, identity, purpose, growth, trust. All of which were too emotional and confusing to ignore.

Shopify was my first full-time coming out of university, and the team I've been in for the past 1.5 years has grown so much. My manager during interns had quit, 5 new developers came within 4 months that I was on break, a new manager came in, etc. Then one day, they stopped working and our journey bifurcates.

My responses:
	- How should I console others?
	- There's a lot to do, but should I commit? Does my work even matter?
	- My manager, one that has made me feel most supported/heard was fired. There’s nobody to talk to. A part of us, the people we dearly interacts with everyday were lost.
	- 1st day went like "fuck it I'm not gonna work". Then 2nd day came to sank it down further. "What now?"
	- To problem solve is to act like owners. How do I own when there's so much outside of my control?

Responses from the company/people:
	- How do you continue on main quests after letting go of impactful people?
	- How was the layoff list made? No great way to answer, no clear strategy, and is a homework for leadership
	- Best thing at Shopify is that we care. On the flip side, everyone shows their discontentment. The way we build world-class work is being open to calling out and telling others to step up.
	- Are we smarter than everyone? No. But if there’s anything, we outcare everyone. We express them. Love and anger shows care. It's indifference that's death.
	- Subtract projects/teams that don't add a lot of value (using gcp for infrastructure), go back to our main quest. The thing that the company sets out to do for million of merchants we serve.
	- Why should I still be excited to work here? Some answers were: learn from exceptional people, serve greater good, feeling of contribution
	- Reshaping ourselves to be leaner and more agile, something that's necessary in this landscape. Not a financial decisions / profitability. When you have limited shape, you try the best you can and reorganize priorities. As shape changes, you take different bets.
	- Parkinsons law: if you get a small group of really good people, and laser focused in certain areas, they tend to do them really good in a short time.
	- Writing less code and more work. The F word in business decisions: 'Focus'. Focus on doing fewer things, and do them well.
	- Thank people before us for what they had built.
	  We are part of the main quest. Shopify, the million of merchants we serve rely on us.
	- Remove toil

After layoffs comes the question of what's next. And living the past quarter, I think I'm still working out the answer to that. Asking myself "What’s stopping myself from doing the best work?" - a lot of things. I figured that I had lots of stress around getting promotions, about finding my priorities, about the effort I wanted to spend on certain things. After all, maybe it's just a job, maybe I had to slow down, maybe it's about **developing your vision** and choosing what to tackle rather than the amount. The days I wasn't busy championing projects, are days that I could re-focus on supporting the team and re-focus my time on personal development, the things I had set aside. Some days I was happy with where I was, while other days I felt I was stagnating came with the feeling that I have not done enough.

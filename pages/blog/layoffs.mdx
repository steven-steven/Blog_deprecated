# Layoffs

<Time>{meta.date}</Time>

I haven't written in a while. So much to write, so much to commit, so much postponing. Layoffs were one huge thing that happened this year (on May 4. Yes, may the 4th be with you) that I wished not to postpone writing before end of year. Rooted in the event, was common themes like lost, friendship, identity, purpose, growth, trust. All of which were too emotional and confusing to set aside.

Shopify was my first full-time coming out of university, and the team I've been in for the past 1.5 years has grown so much. My manager during interns had quit, 5 new developers came during the 4 months that I was on break, a new manager came in, etc. Then one day, they stopped working and our journey bifurcates.

Some of my responses:
  - How should I console others?
  - There's a lot to do, but should I commit? Does my work even matter?
  - My manager, one that has made me feel most supported/heard was fired. There’s nobody to talk to. A part of us, the people we dearly interacts with everyday were lost.
  - 1st day went like "fuck it I'm not gonna work". Then 2nd day came to sank it down further. "What now?"
  - To problem solve is to act like owners. How do I own when so much is out of my control?

Some of the responses from the company/people:
  - How do you continue on main quests after letting go of impactful people?
  - How was the layoff list made? No great way to answer, no clear strategy
  - Everyone showing their discontentment is good. The way we build world-class work is being open to calling out and telling others to step up.
  - Are we smarter than everyone? No. But if there’s anything, we outcare everyone. We express them. Love and anger shows care. It's indifference that's death.
  - Subtract projects/teams that don't add a lot of value, go back to our main quest. The thing that the company sets out to do for million of merchants we serve.
  - Why should I still be excited to work here? Some answers were: learn from exceptional people, serve greater good, ability to contribute.
  - Reshaping ourselves to be leaner and more agile, something that's necessary in this landscape. Not a financial decision. When you have limited shape, you try the best you can and reorganize priorities. As shape changes, you take different bets.
  - Parkinsons law: if you get a small group of really good people, and laser focused in certain areas, they tend to do them really good in a short time.
  - Writing less code and more work. The F word in business decisions: 'Focus'. Focus on doing fewer things, and do them well.
  - Thank people before us for what they had built.
  - Remove toil

After layoffs comes the question of what's next. And living the past quarter, I think I'm still working out the answer to that. Asking myself "What’s stopping myself from doing the best work?" - a lot of things. I figured that I had lots of stress around getting promotions, about finding my priorities, about the effort I wanted to spend on certain things. After all, maybe it's just a job, maybe I had to slow down in order to focus, maybe it's about **developing your vision** and choosing what to tackle rather than the amount. On supporting the team, on supporting my time on personal development, the things I had once set aside. After all, you are you. Your work isn't you. I reminded myself.
